REVIEWER 1
Reviewer 1, Comment 1: This study led by Eid, Jaisil, Guo et al.,
demonstrate that long-term ketogenic diet (KD) preserves peripheral
nerve structure and function and reshapes metabolic and transcriptional
pathways in both nerve and muscle, providing strong preclinical evidence
that KD can prevent MetS-induced peripheral neuropathy. The integration
of metabolic, hepatic, muscular, neural, and transcriptomic endpoints is
impressive, with implications for whole health in addition to
neuropathy. This study has a comprehensive experimental design,
including both prevention and intervention paradigms, which is uncommon
and strengthens causal inference and allows comparison of additive vs
independent effects.

Our response: Thank reviewer

Reviewer 1, Comment 2: From my understanding, a central interpretive gap
is the absence of comparisons between intervention groups (KDI, EXI,
KDI-EXI) and the SDI diet-reversal group. As currently presented, all
intervention effects are interpreted only relative to HFD? This leaves
open the possibility that some improvements are driven by stopping HFD
rather than by the interventions themselves. Analyses of KDI vs SDI, EXI
vs SDI, and KDI-EXI vs SDI could help determine intervention-specific
benefits. Authors could at least perform an analysis that removes DEGs
shared between SDI vs HFD and each intervention vs HFD. This would
isolate genes and pathways uniquely affected by KDI, EXI, or KDI-EXI
rather than those reflecting generic reversal of HFD-induced injury.

Our response: Explain that we tried to be focused about which
interventions we did to keep story clean

Maybe Junguk has these or can make these comparisons publicly available
in repository?

Reviewer is saying that improvements are simply driven by stopping HFD
rather than by the interventions themselves, but this would not be true
for the EX group who remain on HFD

At least do analysis in last sentence, compare interventions but take
out genes that overlap so that we are only looking at unique genes for
each intervention and comparing across interventions

EX animals never stop HFD – do pathway enrichment of unique DEGs (Venn
diagram)

Reviewer 1, Comment 3: While the authors state that their transcriptomic
profiling is exploratory, the differential expression analyses rely on
unadjusted p-values, and PCA shows no clear group separation. Without
FDR correction, many of the reported DEGs and enriched pathways may
represent statistical noise rather than robust biological effects.
Several physiological and transcriptional changes are described, but the
relationships between diet, exercise, and neuropathy remain associative,
and the conclusions and discussion should clearly reflect this.

Our response: Agree and add as a limitation

Reviewer 1, Comment 4: Pathways highlighted in the manuscript
particularly immune signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and
lipid metabolism can be highly cell-type specific. Because bulk RNA-seq
averages signals across many cell populations, these findings cannot be
confidently mapped to specific cells. The authors could strengthen their
interpretation by using existing single-cell reference datasets (e.g.
Eid et al., J Neurochem 2023) to perform bulk RNA-seq deconvolution,
which would help identify which cell types drive the observed
transcriptomic shifts. Recent methodological benchmarks, such as Xu et
al. Briefings in Bioinformatics (2025), provide clear guidelines for
selecting appropriate deconvolution tools. At minimum, the authors
should discuss the limitations inherent to bulk transcriptomics and
maintain conclusions at an appropriately associative level.

Our response: Did do cybersort but didn’t see anything really
interesting, add a sentence and say data not shown (don’t add data),
love your comment, felt the same way, trends, nothing significant made
sense, elected to not include as supplemental, elected to state in a
sentence with data not shown that we didn’t see anything, just didn’t
work

In addition to molecular changes in the SCN and GASTROC transcriptome,
we were also interested in cellular changes underlying diets and
interventions. As bulk RNA-seq lacks cell-type specificity, we used the
CIBERSORTx analytical tool to cluster and estimate cellular
heterogeneity using cell type-specific marker gene expression in SCN
(49) and GASTROC (50) samples. This approach identified 17 total cell
clusters in the SCN and 15 total cell clusters in the GASTROC (Figure
8).

In the SCN, 31-38% of the cell transcriptomes were assigned to
myelinating Schwann cells, regardless of diet or intervention (Figure
8A; Figure S16A; Table S28). We observed an increase in the percentage
of endothelial (blood nerve barrier) and CD4 T helper cells with HFD
compared to SD (Figure 8A; Figure S16A; Table S28 and S29). HFD also
induced a trending increase in the levels of fibroblasts (fibro;
p-value=0.1) and decrease in non-myelinating Schwann cells (nmSCs;
p-value=0.074) compared to SD, although these changes did not reach
statistical significance. A rise in endothelial cells was noted in
long-term KD animals relative to SD (Figure 8A; Figure S16A; Table S28
and S29). When comparing long-term KD to HFD, CD4 T helper cells were
more abundant in SCN from HFD animals, whereas nmSCs were less prevalent
in HFD animals compared to KD (Figure 8A; Figure S16A; Table S28 and
S29). Cell-type composition between HFD and intervention groups showed
no significant differences. However, a trending increase in nmSCs in the
DR group compared to the HFD group (p-value=0.053) was noted.
Additionally, EX increased CD8 T cell (p-value=0.052) and decreased CD4
T cell levels (p-value=0.087) relative to the HFD group, although these
changes did not reach statistical significance. When comparing
interventions, the percentage of myeloid cell lineage cells was
significantly higher while vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes
were lower in EX compared to KDI-EX animals (Figure 8A; Figure S16A;
Table S28 and S29).

In the GASTROC, 35-39% of the cell transcriptomes were consistently
attributed to myonuclei cells, irrespective of diet or intervention
(Figure 8B; Figure S16B; Table S28). A HFD induced a decrease in the
levels of dendritic cells and a trending increase in myoblasts
(p-value=0.089). When comparing a KD to SD, we observed an increase in
the percentage of muscle stem cells with KD (Figure 8B; Figure S16B;
Table S28 and S29). KD also reduced monocytes versus HFD animals (Figure
8B; Figure S16B; Table S28 and S29). With interventions, we observed a
significant increase in the percentage of dendritic and T cells and a
decrease in monocytes with DR compared to HFD (Figure 8B; Figure S16B;
Table S28 and S29). A similar decrease in monocytes was noted in KDI-EX
animals relative to HFD. In the EX group, monocyte levels were also
reduced, although this change did not achieve statistical significance
(p-value=0.067; Figure 8B; Figure S16B; Table S28 and S29). The
percentage of dendritic cells was also significantly higher in DR
animals compared to the other interventions (Figure 8B; Figure 16B;
Table S28 and S29). Finally, T cells were more abundant in GASTROC from
DR animals than EX mice (Figure 8B; Figure 16B; Table S28 and S29).
These results indicate that, in the GASTROC, changes in cell-type were
predominantly observed in immune system components in response to diet
or interventions.

Reviewer 1, Comment 5: Exercise benefits to nerve and muscle may depend
on intensity, duration, and modality, none of which are controlled or
quantified in mechanistic terms. This limits interpretation of
EX-specific adaptations and should be discussed.

Our response: This is in Keto CNS, completely agree and published as
suppl data, have re-written section to be more clear according to
reviewer’s comments

[A graph of frequency and frequency AI-generated content may be

Reviewer 1, Comment 6: Given well-documented sex differences in
metabolic regulation and neuropathy susceptibility, the exclusive use of
male mice restricts the translational relevance of the findings and
should be discussed.

Our response: We mention this in the limitations, but can highlight it
more, completely agree, what a great suggestion, this is amzing

REVIEWER 2
Reviewer 2, Comment 1: This article provides detailed data in support of
the preventative and therapeutic affects of ketogenic diet and exercise
on peripheral Neuropathy in metabolic syndrome in mice.

Our response: Thank you

Reviewer 2, Comment 2: The extensive RNAseq data has not been confirmed
at the protein level by WB or IF. Also some of the presumed metabolites
by histological staining. It would be critical to define some lead
targets for mechanistic studies at least in cell culture models.

Our response: We have protein lysate, need to do PCR, can also try
Western blot, PCR on something different than the Western – have to
check on what was left

Reviewer 2, Comment 3: The statement on the last sentence in page 12:
"comparing KD versus HFD identified 451 DEGs, including reduced serpine
-1,, a senescence marker with enrichment in senescence and p53 signaling
pathways" is confusing. Is there an increase in senescence markers and
SASP? If yes which specific markers are regulated? What are the effects
of KD and exercise?

Our response: This is something that we noticed in this study and are
now exploring further. No. – This is outside the scope of the study,
just focus on comparison of interventions vs. HFD, panel is from EMBO
paper

[A screenshot of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.]

Reviewer 2, Comment 4: A mechanistic figure, such as the ones used in
graphical abstract, summarizing the results and conclusions would be
very helpful and enhance the article.

Our response: We can make a graphical abstract, not required, but
encouraged

REVIEWER 3
Reviewer 3, Comment 1: In this manuscript, the authors test whether
ketogenic diet, exercise, or both impact peripheral neuropathy in
metabolic syndrome mice induced by high fat diet.  The authors also
begin to evaluate the mechanism for protection by bulk seq
transcriptomic experiments from both peripheral nerve and muscle.
Strengths of this manuscript include the clinical relevance of these
translational experiments, the demonstration that combined therapy of
both ketogenic diet and exercise is better than either alone, and the
analysis of transcriptomic experiments. There are few weaknesses, but
they are deemed minor and correctable. These weaknesses are detailed
below.

Our response: Thank you

Reviewer 3, Comment 2: I don’t like the term “preventative” to describe
the experiments comparing mice treated with normal, high fat, and
ketogenic diets.  What is the ketogenic diet preventing?  The importance
of these experiments is that the ketogenic diet does not induce the same
toxicity as high fat diet, but the mice are not treated simultaneously
with high fat and ketogenic diet, so preventative seems inappropriate.
This should be modified throughout the manuscript and figures.

Our response: I get what they are saying, but not sure what other word
we would use? Maintenance?

Reviewer 3, Comment 3: The neuromuscular junction quantification is
different than most other publications. This one uses a histologic stain
(acetylcholinesterase solution) and staining of nerve fibers with
neurofilament. Most publications use a fluorescently labeled
bungarotoxin to label muscle NMJ and presynaptic components labeled
immunostaining synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals. This allows
for quantification of fully innervated, partially innervated or
denervated NMJs. Given the lack of significant changes in this
manuscript, perhaps this is due to the technique. Authors should
consider restaining and analyzing the muscle with this protocol. If not,
they should add a figure showing a photomicrograph of their staining in
supplemental figures and also justify the use of this method in the
paper.

Our response: Add pictures. Justify – we’ve published three papers using
this method. Ian can help with taking the pictures

Reviewer 3, Comment 4: The PCA analysis did not demonstrate defined
separate groups. The importance or explanation of this should be
discussed further in the paper.

Our response: And a sentence into the results. Agree, good point

Reviewer 3, Comment 5: The discussion of NMJ innervation results is
misleading. State that “EXI uniquely increased NMJ innervation,
improving neuromuscular connectivity.”  Though technically true, it is
hard to know how to interpret the importance of this result given that
HFD did not induce a change in NMJ innervation.

Our response: Soften the language

Reviewer 3, Comment 6: All of the transcriptomics was completed in nerve
or muscles at the end of the study. Is there injury to the sciatic nerve
at this time?  If so, would be nice to see what happens to these gene
changes earlier prior to the onset of peripheral nerve injury. Similarly
for the muscle, as it would be good to assess for gene changes PRIOR to
denervation atrophy.

Our response: Agree that this would be interesting to look at and focus
of future studies

Reviewer 3, Comment 7: I suspect that many of the gene changes are
related to correction of metabolic syndrome by treatments with ketogenic
diet or exercise.  Could the muscle be used as a control for the changes
in the nerve. Authors should compare gene changes in muscle to those in
nerve to assess for this. Would be particularly interested in gene
changes that are happening in nerve and NOT in muscle.

Our response: Meet with Junguk, Do cross tissue comparison like we did
in

REVIEWER 4
Reviewer 4, Comment 1: The work is highly impressive. However, the
introduction does not fully do justice to the strength and significance
of the study. I recommend revising this section, as it is currently
weaker than the rest of the manuscript. Also, it feels somewhat
fragmented. A more cohesive and comprehensive introduction would better
contextualize the study.

Our response: Re-write introduction

Reviewer 4, Comment 2: Under the limitations section, the authors should
further elaborate on the use of only male mice. Given that sex
differences can influence metabolic syndrome susceptibility and
neuropathy outcomes, it would be helpful for the authors to address
whether female mice may show different metabolic or neurobiological
responses. discuss how this may affect the interpretation, and future
directions of the work

Our response: Highlight/expand more in limitations, Refer back to
previous reviewer. As mentioned…
